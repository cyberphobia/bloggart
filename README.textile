Bloggart is a blog application for Google App Engine. It was developed as a demonstration app for <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2009/10/Writing-a-blog-system-on-App-Engine">a series of blog posts</a> by Nick Johnson. This is a fork that ports the application to python27 and has some other minor improvements (e.g. uses jinja2 instead of django for templating).
